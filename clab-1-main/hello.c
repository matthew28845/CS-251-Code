To use this program, you must first 'compile' it --- meaning, translate it into 
the machine language of your computer. To do this, navigate in a Visual Studio Code 
terminal to the directory where you have this file. Then enter

	clang 00mainHelloWorld.c

A file called a.out should appear. This is the executable program. Enter 

	./a.out

to run the program. Do all of this now. Observe the program's output. Then come back here 
and study the code. */
